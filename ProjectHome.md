Code for a Bluetooth controlled robotic tank.

The robot is controlled by the Parallax Propeller and a Bluetooth wireless serial module. The Bluetooth serial module connects to a Nokia N810 via rfcomm wireless connection.

The N810 can control the various servos and DC motors via a simple serial protocol. The N810 device can even serve as bridge so that the robot can be controlled by a Wii controller.
